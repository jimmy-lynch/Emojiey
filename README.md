# Emojiey
### By Jimmy Lynch

This is an emoji display information application. It includes a searchable list of emojis, when an emoji is clicked another page is displayed with more information on each emoji (tags, attributes, iOS version, etc).

Key concepts utilized include:
- Codable & Decoding a JSON file
- ScrollView & LazyVGrid

Improvement reflection:
- Could better styilize the emojiView screen.
- Should anchor the search bar so when scrolled down it's still visible at the top.
