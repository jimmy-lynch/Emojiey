# Emojiey
### By Jimmy Lynch

This is a simple weather display application, utilizing OpenWeather API to draw the data. This project was done to practice using API calls and the MVVM design pattern.

Key concepts utilized include:
- Codable & Decoding a JSON file
- ScrollView & LazyVGrid

Improvement reflection:
- Could better styilize the emojiView screen.
- Should anchor the search bar so when scrolled down it's still visible at the top.
